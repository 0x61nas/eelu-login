Args:
[-user | --user | --username | -username |  -u]   <username>  :  username to login with

usertype can be :

```

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your EELU Moodle login credentials, and `< staff | sys-user | student>` with your user type.

If you don't want to enter your credentials every time you run the tool, you can set the `SIS_EELU_USERNAME` and `SIS_EELU_PASSWORD` environment variables to your username and password respectively.

You can don't need to specify the user, and the tool will be try to login as a student and if it fails it will try to login as a staff and if it fails it will try to login as a system user.
